								My brother Patrick Murray was born in Knob Noster, Missouri and grew up in Jefferson City, Missouri. During elementary school Patrick attended St. Stanislaus Elementary school before transferring to the Blair Oaks school district for middle and high school. While attending Blair Oaks Patrick was a member of the football, and track and field teams, as well as being a member of the band for three years in high school. After graduating as his class valedictorian, Patrick attended Washington University in St. Louis for his bachelor’s degree where he majored in architecture, and continued his football career by joining the WashU Bears. After graduating with his bachelors, Patrick stayed at WashU to pursue his master’s degree which he dual majored in Architecture and Construction Management. After graduating with his Master’s degree, Patrick moved to Chicago and now works for Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture where he is currently taking his licensure exams to become a licensed architect in the state of Illinois. Patrick has dreamed of being an architect since he was a small child. As a kid, Patrick enjoyed drawing houses and buildings of all sorts, and one day, when discussing a particular house he wanted to draw, his mother mentioned that he should be an architect, and ever since then his goal has been to become an architect, and now he is closer than ever.
